She was determined to shine a light inside the minds of the Giants and her ambition was realized with each swing of her trusty Fancy Pick.\r\n\r\nYou see, before Sparkla, the rocks that we now call \"Sparkly\" were called \"Beanfarters' Ore\" and, as such, did not attract much of a following. Indeed, no-one knew that they were rich in the shiny element — no-one even knew that there was a shiny element. Until Sparkla came along.\r\n\r\nWhile the Assembly members gathered to discuss the various motions before the various councils and debate the \"serious\" questions of the day, Sparkla's simple desire was to express her gratitude to the Giants for the newly restored world, following Esquibeth's Last Pilgrimage. \r\n\r\nBecause she had never heard them called Beanfarters' Ore, she could more clearly see the true nature of the sparkly rocks that abounded in the newly arranged world of Ur and could see the shine inside of them. \r\n\r\nAnd so she alone, despite her advanced years, managed to mine and donate an astounding 1,234,577 chunks of sparkly rock to shrines all over the world. And that is why, today, the special little rock is known as \"Sparkly\".","epic":"The Penyahtewan Assembly","total":9434634,"unit":"chunks of sparkly donated","reward":{"iMG, ":2469154,"currants, ":2469154,"mood, ":2469154,"energy, and ":2469154,"favor with Zille,  ":1234577},"goals":{"minimum":1234577,"bonus":11111117,"supermega":33333331}}
