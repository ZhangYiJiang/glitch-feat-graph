They ran, they jumped, they reasoned and they solved like no other time.\r\n\r\nThere was Butska the strongman, Gwendolyn the nimble, Percival the quick-of-mind and an unnamed Priestess of Tii whose sacred numinations underwrote the decision making of a thousand-and-nine lesser champions. And there were many more, besides.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the Assembly, after having welcomed both old friends and new, they decided to have an extended closing ceremony and perform a myriad of quests for one another.\r\n\r\nEach took turns astounding and goading-on the others (though in between times, during the completion of the more prosaic tasks, they mostly took turns occupying one another's glazed-over field of vision).\r\n\r\nBy the time it was over, there were rocks hewn and boards cut and platforms leapt and beds made and routes mapped and supper-on-the-table again for everyone.","epic":"The Penyahtewan Assembly","total":49672,"unit":"quests completed","reward":{"iMG, ":3330100,"currants, ":1665050,"mood, and ":233107,"favor with all Giants,  ":66602},"goals":{"minimum":17191,"bonus":33301,"supermega":57751}}
