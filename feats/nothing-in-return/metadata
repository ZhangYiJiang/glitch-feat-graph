No & verily, she did not look at life as an opportunity for her to make a gain on her own account. Abstrixia's gift was to see the beings of the land as fellow travelers to whose well-being she could make a contribution.\r\n\r\nWhere she went, she watered. And she pet. And massaged, and sang to, and sprinkled with helpful powder. And where she trod was there an increase in abundance, in vigor, in richness and in warmth. And it was good.","epic":"An Abstrixian Aside","total":2154100,"unit":"giving actions","reward":{"iMG":1493484,"currants":746742,"mood":1120113,"favor with all Giants":373371},"goals":{"minimum":37337,"bonus":373371,"supermega":3173371}}
