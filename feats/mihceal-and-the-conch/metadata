Top contributors received a piece of an ancient artifact. The recreation of this feat unlocked the region Firozi.","legend":"Mihceal, nephew of Esquibeth, third of his name, ninth in line as the Duke of Firozi, was a handsome boy and well-loved by all. But he was also a little bit annoying.\r\n\r\nWhen his famous aunt returned from her last pilgrimage, she let him hold the conch she took as an artifact … and that seemed to be a mistake.\r\n\r\nMihceal played the conch for everyone he saw! And then he moved over so that he saw other people and played it for them as well. And he kept doing that, over and over, until he had played the conch for 27,179 different people.\r\n\r\nBut what no-one knew was that the song he played was what allowed the Giants to remember so many places for so long.\r\n\r\nIn the millennia since then, his home region of Firozi has been forgotten by the Giants. But legend has it that if we all play the conch enough times for enough other people, Firozi will be remembered once more.","epic":"","total":45753,"unit":"conchs played for different people","reward":{},"goals":{"minimum":27179,"bonus":null,"supermega":null}}
