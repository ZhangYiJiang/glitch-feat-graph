{"id":"good-neighbor","url":"http://www.glitch.com/feats/good-neighbor/","name":"The Good Neighbor","desc":"Everyone likes to play the host, but not everyone has as many opportunities to do so as they might wish. It takes visitors to make visitees and guests to make hosts. So, make like Abstrixia and turn some home streets of some new friends pink with the joy of visitation.\r\n\r\nYou get a point for using a visiting stone to visit someone's home street — that is tripled, to three points, if it is your first time using that particular visiting stone during this feat. Earn another two points for leaving a package with the butler of the person you visited. \r\n\r\nTips: (1) you'll find visiting stones on the far ends of dead-end streets all over the world. Almost every dead-end street has one, so just look at the maps to seek them out.\r\n\r\n(2) After using a visiting stone and arriving on someone's home street, you can use the the \"back to world\" button in your iMG menu or the \"/leave\" command to return to the stone you just used. But don't forget to leave a package first!\r\n\r\n(3) Butlers have a limit of five packages each, so remember to visit your own home street from time to time to clear out your packages — otherwise they'll all get full up!\r\n\r\n(4) If you want to receive visitors from the visiting stones as well, you can just march up to one and click on it to opt in.","legend":"Abstrixia knew how nice it was to receive visitors, especially for those new to the world. So, she did a lot of visiting — hither and yon, over hill and over dale, to and fro, and all that. She visited in the morning and she visited in the evening and she left nice little housewarming presents for everyone.\r\n\r\nTo honor the joy she brought across the world, we too shall go a-visitin' and a-gift-leavin'. And since the visiting stones give priority to those who have had the fewest visitors, we'll use those to find new people to visit.","epic":"An Abstrixian Aside","total":528368,"unit":"visitation points","reward":{"iMG, ":533361,"mood, ":888935,"energy, and ":533361,"favor with all Giants,  ":177787},"goals":{"minimum":24203,"bonus":177787,"supermega":666667}}
