So, she did a lot of visiting â€” hither and yon, over hill and over dale, to and fro, and all that. She visited in the morning and she visited in the evening and she left nice little housewarming presents for everyone.\r\n\r\nTo honor the joy she brought across the world, we too shall go a-visitin' and a-gift-leavin'. And since the visiting stones give priority to those who have had the fewest visitors, we'll use those to find new people to visit.","epic":"An Abstrixian Aside","total":528368,"unit":"visitation points","reward":{"iMG":533361,"mood":888935,"energy":533361,"favor with all Giants":177787},"goals":{"minimum":24203,"bonus":177787,"supermega":666667}}
